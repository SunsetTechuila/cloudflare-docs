:::note

Setting up a static IP address to configure a DNS server may prevent you from connecting to some public Wi-Fi networks that use captive portals â€” these are the web pages some wireless networks employ to let users log in and use their services.

If you are experiencing connectivity issues related to captive portals:

1. Remove the static IP addresses from the device or disable the 1.1.1.1 app.
2. Connect to the Wi-Fi network.
3. Once the connection has been established, re-add the static IP addresses or enable the 1.1.1.1 app.

If you are using a network with captive portal often you can do the following:

1. Remove the static IP addresses from the device or disable the 1.1.1.1 app.
2. Connect to the Wi-Fi network.
3. Copy the address of the captive portal login page
3. Get automatic DNS address:

```powershell
$dns = Get-DnsClientServerAddress -AddressFamily IPv4 | Where-Object {$_.InterfaceAlias -eq (Get-NetAdapter | Where-Object {$_.Status -eq "Up"}).Name} | Select-Object -ExpandProperty ServerAddresses
```

4. Set DNS rule:

```powershell
Add-DnsClientNrptRule -Namespace "login_page_address" -NameServers $dns
```
